<p>Knowledge workers can manage their notifications generated by Eureka, via in app 
notifications and/or emails.  Group coordinators and Eureka administrators do recieve some 
default notifications.</p>

posted by a colleague to their stream.</li>
<li>The knowledge worker must be able to receive a notification when a colleague likes an 
activity posted by the knowledge worker. </li>
<li>The knowledge worker must be able to receive a notification for when a comment is posted 
to an activity posted by or commented on by the knowledge worker.</li>

notifications</li>
<li>The knowledge worker must be alerted when high priority notifications are unread 
differently than normal unread notifications.</li>
<li>The knowledge worker must be able to filter notifications by source (stream of app of 
notification origin)</li>
<li>The knowledge worker must be able to see the count of notifications by source</li>
<li>The knowledge worker must be able to filter between &#8220;all&#8221; and &#8220;unread&#8221; notifications</li>
<li>The knowledge worker must be able to mark all notifications as read</li>
<li>The knowledge worker must mark a notification individually as read only by clicking it</li>
<li>The knowledge worker must be able to delete an individual notification</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Filters on the left allow the user to filter between all notifications or
notifications for a particular stream or app source. Clicking on &#8220;Stream&#8221; or
&#8220;Apps&#8221; will show all notifications in those sub groups.</li>
<li>Notifications can be filtered to show all or unread notifications. Read
notifications are show as darker in color (in picture above, the third
notification is &#8220;read&#8221;). High Priority notifications are always sorted to the
top. A notification is only marked as read if it is clicked or the mark all as
read button is clicked (more details below).</li>
<li>Lets the user mark all notifications in the current view as &#8220;read&#8221;</li>
<li>Switches the Modal to the config view (see below)</li>
<li>A notification itself. The icon shows is the avatar of the person or group generating the notification. A &#8220;system&#8221; and &#8220;app&#8221; icon will be used for when the Admin or an app through the API sends a notification. Clicking the notification takes the user to the notification&#8217;s target. Hovering brings up the two options shown.</li>
<li>Hovering over the delete icon expands it with a tool tip. Clicking it deletes the notification</li>
<li>Hovering over the stop icon expands in the same fashion with the text &#8220;Stop Notifications Like This&#8221;. Clicking it unchecks both In App and Email settings for that notification type. This icon does not appear on notifications the user can not unsubscribe to.</li>
<li>High-Priority notifications are always sorted to the top regardless of date and have a red bar to distinguish them.</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Notifications are retained for 14 days.</li>
<li>A single notification is generated based on any given event.  The type of message sent is picked based on the following order: 1) Authorship, 2) Who&#8217;s stream is updated; 3) scenario for commenting.  For example, in the scenario where a knowledge worker posts a message to his stream and comments on his message, the knowledge worker would receive message #2 instead of message #4 since the original message was generated by the knowledge worker.</li>
</ol>

<li>Email is sent to a knowledge worker when a message is posted to your stream. The word &#8216;message&#8217; is replaced with &#8216;link&#8217; when a link is posted and the link name is displayed after the message in blue.  Refer to #6 for an example.</li>
</ol>
