<p>﻿##Overview
Owners of sites outside of Eureka are able to integrate Eureka features into
their websites using Eureka Connect. Knowledge workers are then able to access
Eureka features without visiting Eureka and never leaving the site. Eureka Connect is made 
up of the following widgets: </p>

<ol>
<li>The profile badge widget which allows a resource owner to showcase the
Eureka avatar, display name, business unit, and title of any user via NTID.</li>
<li>The like/share widget which allows a resource owner to allow
knowledge workers to like or share any given resource.</li>
<li>The stream widget which allows a resource owner to embed a stream
into their website</li>
<li>The comment widget which is a specialized stream widget that aggregates
comments and share about a particular resource and allows for knowledge workers to add 
comments to the resource.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="userexperience">User Experience</h2>

<h3 id="defaultstateofwidgets">Default State of Widgets</h3>

<p><img id="" src="images/connect_blank.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>The profile badge widget shows the Eureka avatar, Eureka name with link to profile, title 
from Eureka and Organization from LDAP. If the user is not in Eureka the default Avatar is shown, along with a non-linkable name from LDAP, and title and org from LDAP as well.</li>
<li>The like part of the like/share widget. More details below.</li>
<li>The share part of the like/share widget. More details below.</li>
<li>The Comment widget. More details below.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="thecommentwidget">The Comment Widget</h3>

<p><img id="" src="images/connect_post_selected.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>When the user selects the Leave a Comment box the box expands to allow them to type in their comment. This behaves similarly to Eureka&#8217;s post box, with TOS message and character count down</li>
<li>The Post to Eureka checkbox allows the user to have their comment automatically posted into their stream on Eureka. It is defaulted to the checked position. If a non-Eureka user is posting a comment this checkbox does not appear, and the avatar is the default avatar.</li>
</ol>

<p><img id="" src="images/connect_post_posted.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>Once the post button is hit the comment shows up in an embedded stream below. The same options available in Eureka are available here, including sorting and searching. The stream behaves identically to Eureka, allowing users to like, comment on, share, flag, and delete (if allowed) activity. It also has a view more button that functions identically to Eureka by showing the next ten `comments. The sorting, searching, and RSS bar can be turned off by the owner of the widget.</li>
</ol>

<p><img id="" src="images/connect_in_eureka.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>If the user leaves the Post to Eureka checkbox checked, the activity will show up on their stream in Eureka. If the user deletes the activity on his/her profile the activity IS NOT deleted on the original resource. If the user deletes the activity from the original resource it IS deleted from his/her profile.</p>

<ol>
<li>The first link is to the article itself. The title of the link is configurable by the owner of the widget. </li>
<li>The second link is to the homepage the article is from. This is optional and configurable by the owner of the widget. If not specified the activity should leave this part off and end with a link back to the source link.</li>
</ol>

<p><img id="" src="images/connect_comment_full.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>The comment widget also shows all shares across Eureka of the resource the
widget is configured for. The activity mentions the stream it was shared to
with a link to the stream within Eureka. All comments and likes on this
activity are synced across both the widget and Eureka.</li>
<li>The comment widget allows for non-Eureka users to post. These posts are not
visible in Eureka but show up in the widget with a default avatar and the
users name from LDAP.</li>
<li>Regular posts that have been posted back to Eureka will sync all likes and
comments between the widget and Eureka.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="thelikesharewidget">The Like/Share Widget</h3>

<p><img id="" src="images/connect_like_share_widget.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>The badge shows the number of people who have liked or shared the resource.
Users who have already liked a resource see &#8220;Unlike&#8221;</li>
<li>Hovering over a badge shows a popup with up to 4 users who have liked or
shared the resource. </li>
<li>If more than 4 users have liked or shared the resource, a view all button
allows the user to see all the users who have liked or shared it.</li>
</ol>

<p><img id="" src="images/connect_like_dialog.gif" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>When the user clicks the number of Likers or Sharers or the View All button,
a new window opens up showing all the users who have liked or shared the item,
depending on which number they&#8217;ve chosen to see.</p>

<p><img id="" src="images/connect_share_dialog.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>When the user clicks the Share button on the Like/Share widget, a new window
opens that allows them to post the link to Eureka on any stream. Behavior of
this widget is identical to that on Eureka.</p>

<h3 id="thestreamwidget">The Stream Widget</h3>

<p><img id="" src="images/stream_widget_small.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>In addition to a full stream widget, which looks and functions exactly like a
stream in Eureka, and allows for the full set of functionality (posting,
sorting, searching, etc). A condensed version of the stream widget that only
allows the user to view activity must also be made available. The number of
activities to show is configurable. </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="theprofilewidget">The Profile Widget</h3>

<p><img id="" src="images/connect_follow_before.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>The follow widget must display a configurable image, the followers count,
and a follow button if the user has not followed already. Clicking the follow
button will automatically follow the user the widget has been set up for.</li>
</ol>

<p><img id="" src="images/connect_follow_after.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<ol>
<li>If the user is following the configured user already (or has just clicked the
Follow button) the button displays &#8220;View Stream&#8221; and when clicked navigates to
the Eureka stream for the configured user.</li>
</ol>
