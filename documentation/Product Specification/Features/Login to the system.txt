## Overview
Logging into the system is based on the credentials of the user and authentication schemes being used.   A knowledge worker with access to the system authenticates.  A knowledge worker who does not have access to the system needs to request access.
## Conditions of satisfaction
1. The knowledge worker must be able to request access if he is not authorized to login to the system.
2. The knowledge worker must be able to login via a form authenticating credentials against a kerberos or ldap backend.
3. The knowledge worker must be able to login via the http negotiate protocol authenticating credentials against a kerberos backend.
## User experience

![](images/PS_F01_login_loginForm.png)

1. Valid user name must be entered.
2. Valid password must be entered. Password is masked when typed.
3. Remembers the user name and password after initial login and automatically logs the user in when launching Eureka Streams.
4. Logs user into Eureka Streams or displays a message on invalid login: "The username or password you entered is incorrect"
5. Return user to the EurekaStreams.org website.

1. Message displays if user does not have access to the Eureka Streams. EurekaStreams.org should be a link to the website.

![](images/PS_F01_login_TermsofService.png)

1. Terms of Service message from the System Settings.
2. Agree button is disabled until the user enables the 'I have read and understand the terms of service.' checkbox.
3. If Cancel button is clicked, redirect user to eurekastreams.org.



## Test plans
### Knowledge Worker
1. **Action: Request access if he is not authorized to login to the system**
    *  Verify that if the knowledge worker does not have access, the eureka login screen is displayed with an access message and a link to request access and the knowledge worker is unable to access the system
    *  Verify that if integrated authentication is implemented, the user name and password fields are not displayed
    *  Verify that if integrated authentication is not implemented, the user name and password fields are displayed
2. **Action: Login via a form authenticating credentials against a kerberos or ldap backend**
    *  Verify the knowledge worker needs to enter his user name and password
    *  Verify the knowledge worker can select the keep me logged in option
    *  Verify the terms of service display when a new knowledge worker logs in
    *  Verify the knowledge worker is not prompted for login information if the keep me logged in option was enabled on login
3. **Action: Login via the http negotiate protocol authenticating credentials against a kerberos backend**
    *  Verify the knowledge worker is automatically logged if he has access
### Group Coordinator
1. **Action: Execute same tests as Knowledge Worker**
    *  Verify tests executed successfully
### Organization Coordinator
1. **Action: Execute same tests as Knowledge Worker**
    *  Verify tests executed successfully
### Root Organization Coordinator
1. **Action: Execute same tests as Knowledge Worker**
    *  Verify tests executed successfully
