To address the problem space, [personas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_%28marketing%29) were identified representing large segments of users in terms of their goals and characteristics. This approach established constraints on the scope of the solution while understanding the driving behavior of the end-user. The four personas identified for Eureka Streams are defined below:
